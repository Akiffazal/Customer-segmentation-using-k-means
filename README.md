# Customer Segmentation using K-Means

## Project Description

This project is a comprehensive study of customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The goal is to understand the behavior of customers and categorize them based on their purchasing habits and other factors. This information can then be used to target specific customer groups with marketing campaigns and other strategies.

## Data

The data used in this project is a customer dataset with features like ID, gender, age, income, and spending score. This data is loaded and analyzed to understand the structure and summary statistics.

## Data Analysis

The project begins with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and summary statistics. This includes checking for missing values and handling them appropriately.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization is a crucial part of this project. It includes visualizing the gender distribution among customers using a pie chart. This helps in understanding the composition of the customer base.

## Clustering

The main part of the project is clustering the customers using the K-Means algorithm. This involves choosing the appropriate number of clusters, running the algorithm, and analyzing the results.

## Results and Conclusion

The results of the clustering are then analyzed and conclusions are drawn. These insights can be used to inform targeted marketing strategies.

## Installation and Usage

To use this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can then clone this repository and run the Jupyter notebook.
